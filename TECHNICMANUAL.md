### 2.1 HTML ABOUT-US
For the About-Us HTML, we have linked the html with the Poké Ball svg, and with the css of the index header, the About-us, the reset and with the general CSS. Later, within the header we have inserted the Pokémon logo so that it appears on the left.
Also to insert the links for Home, About Us and the search engine we have implemented an unordered list with the three items.
### 2.2 CSS ABOUT-US
In the About-us CSS we have implemented a main with a text-align: center to center the title and the text, for the text we have implemented a margin-left and a margin-right, at 230 px each to compress the text in the center and a " color: var(--color-secondary); " to change the color of the text.
In the image we have implemented a width of 500 px and we have also implemented a margin-left at 450 px and a margin-right at 250 px to reduce its size to a normal size.
